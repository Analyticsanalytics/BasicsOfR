1) Uploading the data
2) Cleaning the data
        Checking NA values. Run imputation or remove or replace NAs with mean or zero
        Histogram of quantitative variables
        Checking Outliars and cieling & flooring maxmimum & minimum values. Treatment?

Log & exponentials are taken for skewed values.


################  AIC & Model Selection in Logistic Regression   ####################
AIC for Logistic Regression:- Akaike information criterian. AIC is founded on information theory: it offers a relative estimate of
the information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generates the data. In doing so, it deals with the 
trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the complexity of the model. A model with minimum AIC is most preferred

Hence AIC rewards goodness of fit (as assessed by the likelihood function), but it also includes a penalty that is an increasing function
of the number of estimated parameters. The penalty discourages overfitting (increasing the number of parameters in the model almost always
improves the goodness of the fit).

To test the model:-
  1) We make a confusion matrix and check the error rate
  2) We can look at AIC of the model and compare it with the standard mean error
  3) We can make ROCR curve and look at AUC
