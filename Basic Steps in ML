1) Uploading the data
2) Checking NA values. Run imputation or remove or replace NAs with mean or zero
3) Checking Outliars and cieling & flooring maxmimum & minimum values. Capping them with 95/5th percentiles. If too many values are
     in 95th/5th percentile, then choosing 96th/4th or higher/lower percentile accordingly
4) Checking classes of variables
5) Recoding of the variables (Factor or something else)
6) Exploratory Data Analysis
       Significance relationship be/w dependent & indepedent variables
       Plotting simple statistic values such mean, median, SD etc
       Histogram of quantitative variables
       Checking the assumptions of the related to the technique. FOr linear Reg, check normal distribution of response
       determining relationships among the explanatory variables
        

Log & exponentials are taken for skewed values.


################  AIC & Model Selection in Logistic Regression   ####################
AIC for Logistic Regression:- Akaike information criterian. AIC is founded on information theory: it offers a relative estimate of
the information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generates the data. In doing so, it deals with the 
trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the complexity of the model. A model with minimum AIC is most preferred

Hence AIC rewards goodness of fit (as assessed by the likelihood function), but it also includes a penalty that is an increasing function
of the number of estimated parameters. The penalty discourages overfitting (increasing the number of parameters in the model almost always
improves the goodness of the fit).

To test the model:-
  1) We make a confusion matrix and check the error rate
  2) We can look at AIC of the model and compare it with the standard mean error
  3) We can make ROCR curve and look at AUC
  4)
