#Basic Function
#Removing a variable (TotalDelay) from the dataset

#Copying a column to a df from another df. Here we copy sold column from FLipkart to descriptionText
descriptionText$sold = Flipkart$sold


#Normalizing the data using caret package. for each variable, the normalization process subtracts the mean and divides
#by the standard deviation.In the normalized dataset, all of the variables should have mean 0 and standard deviation 1
