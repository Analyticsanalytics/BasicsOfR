#Basic Function

#Flights with TotalDelay of more than or equal to 5 hours and TimeTaken less than 10 hours
subset(Airlines, TotalDelay >= 5 & TimeTaken < 10)
### OR we can use the below code for same
Airlines[Airlines$TotalDelay >= 5 & Airlines$TimeTaken < 10, ]

#Flights with TotalDelay of less than 6 hours and TimeTaken more than 10 hours
subset(Airlines, TotalDelay < 6 & TimeTaken > 8)

#Checking the levels of factor variable age.range
levels(Airlines$age.range)

#Removing a variable (TotalDelay) from the dataset
Airlines$TotalDelay = NULL

#Remove all the existing contents from R studio
rm(list=ls())

####ADDING DIFFERENT TIME VARIABLES IN THE DATASET
#Suppose the time format in Airlines is like this "2015-05-26 21:45:32". We can add the time variables using the strptime() function of PubDate
#Here we've used "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" bcz date is currently in this format
Airlines$PubDate = strptime(Airlines$PubDate, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

#Now add the variables weekday, Hour & Month in the dataset
Airlines$Weekday = Airlines$PubDate$wday
Airlines$Hour = Airliness$PubDate$hour
Airlines$Month = Airlines$PubDate$mon


#Copying a column to a df from another df. Here we copy sold column from FLipkart to descriptionText
descriptionText$sold = Flipkart$sold

#Suppose there are no columns name in a dataset movie. Add the columns using colnames function
colnames(movies) = c("ID", "Title", "ReleaseDate", "VideoReleaseDate", "IMDB", Thriller", "War", "Western")

#add a "M" in front of all the variable names in movies. check ?paste0()
names(movies) = paste0("M", names(movies))

#Creating a dummy variable Popular in the movies dataset
Nmovies$Popular = rep(0,nrow(movies))




#Normalizing the data using caret package. for each variable, the normalization process subtracts the mean and divides
#by the standard deviation.In the normalized dataset, all of the variables should have mean 0 and standard deviation 1
library(caret)
preproc = preProcess(Flipkart)
FlipNorm = predict(preproc, Flipkart)
