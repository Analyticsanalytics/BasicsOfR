#Basic Function
#Removing a variable (TotalDelay) from the dataset
Airlines$TotalDelay = NULL

#Remove all the existing contents from R studio
rm(list=ls())


#Copying a column to a df from another df. Here we copy sold column from FLipkart to descriptionText
descriptionText$sold = Flipkart$sold

#Suppose there are no columns name in a dataset movie. Add the columns using colnames function
colnames(movies) = c("ID", "Title", "ReleaseDate", "VideoReleaseDate", "IMDB", Thriller", "War", "Western")

#add a "M" in front of all the variable names in movies. check ?paste0()
names(movies) = paste0("M", names(movies))

#Creating a dummy variable Popular in the movies dataset
Nmovies$Popular = rep(0,nrow(movies))




#Normalizing the data using caret package. for each variable, the normalization process subtracts the mean and divides
#by the standard deviation.In the normalized dataset, all of the variables should have mean 0 and standard deviation 1
